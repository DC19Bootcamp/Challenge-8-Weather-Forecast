# Module 8 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

#Challenge 8 - Weather Forcast
Over several weeks I have wrestled with this but managed to get it to work. I had deleted a near complete repo while trying to delete a master branch but had luckily backed up most of my work locally. 

The task was to create a weather dashboard that allows you to search for the current weather and forecast for any city. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the data and display it in the dashboard. When a user enters a city in the search box and submits the form, the code gets the current weather and forecast data for that city and displays it in the dashboard. The search history is also saved and displayed on the page. The data is stored in the browser's localStorage, storing the users last search requests.
